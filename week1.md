# Twitter Bot Workshop - Week 1

## Meet my bots!
### @iLoveIsmBot  
https://twitter.com/iLoveIsmBot  
This bot uses Darius Kazemi's `corpora/art/isms` as a corpus to make absurdist statements about loving various isms.

### @every7SegmentWord
https://twitter.com/7SegmentWords  
This bot tweets every word that is able to be printed on a 7-Segment display. The corprus was generated by a program
that I wrote in Common Lisp to analyze the word list found in /usr/share/dict and filter the list by checking if words
contain any letter that is not printable on a 7-Segment Display. The total number of printable words is X.

### @DerridaSays
https://twitter.com/DerridaSays  
Conjuring Jacques Derrida, this bot bot makes a derridean statement every hour. The corpus for this bot is a set of
collected quotes by Jacques Derrida.

### @JustLikeBot
https://twitter.com/JustLikeBot  
Similar to the @iLoveIsmBot, this bot pairs Darius Kazemi's `corpora/art/isms` corpus with the list of celebrities found
at `corpora/humans/celebrities`. The result is another absurdist bot making statements on "something" is "just like".

### @randomP5Command
https://twitter.com/randomP5Command  
This bot takes the p5 command list and generates a random syntactically correct p5 command every hour. To achieve this with tracery,
I limited my sketch size to be 200x200.
